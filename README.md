# Enlightenment Bot

The Enlightenment Bot seeks to automate the process of enlightenment through meditation.

Based on the esoteric rite of the _gumonji-ho_, where the mantra of the Bodhisattva Kokuzo Bosatsu is recited 1,000,000 times in a row, the enlightenment bot automates the process of meditation.

Most famously the great teacher Kobo Daishi, founder of Japan’s Shingon Buddhism, practiced the rite before attaining enlightenment.

The Enlightenment Bot tweets the Morning Star mantra 10,000 times per day for 100 days.

## History

Originally conceived as a twitter bot that would chant the mantra repetitiously, the gumonjiho was foiled by twitter’s anti-meditative policy of rejecting duplicate tweets. So the bot sits in the aethers of the internet, attempting to chant but being rejected by the message:

`Could not post Tweet. Error: 403 Reason: Status is a duplicate.`

The error message is a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dan](koan) in itself, so I left it this way.

## Instructions

To attempt enlightenment on your server:
```
git clone git://github.com/lchamb/enlightenment.git
cd enlightenment && npm install
[edit app.js if you want to add your twitter keys]
node app.js
```
